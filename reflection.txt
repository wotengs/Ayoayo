Initial Reflection:

When I first saw the Ayoayo take-away assignment, my immediate reaction was that it’s essentially an implementation of Mancala-like sowing mechanics in code, with a couple extra capture rules and an explicit text-based interface. My main concerns were:

Data Modeling: How best to represent the board? I knew each player needs six pits and one store. Using arrays for pits and a separate variable for the store felt natural, and making them private enforces encapsulation.

Class Structure: The requirements call for an Ayoayo class plus a Player class. My first thought was to let the Ayoayo class own two Player instances, and have playGame manipulate those. Keeping board logic in Ayoayo and per-player data in Player keeps responsibilities clear.

Sowing Logic: The core challenge is correctly iterating around both players’ pits and only depositing in the active player’s store. I knew I’d need a helper to wrap around from the last pit on one side to the first pit on the other, skipping the opponent’s store.

Special Rules: The two specials—extra turn when landing in store, capture when landing in an empty pit—felt like post-sow checks. I wanted to isolate them into clear conditional blocks after sowing completes.

End-game Detection: Recognizing when one side’s pits are all empty should trigger capturing of remaining seeds on the other side. A small helper to check emptiness would make playGame cleaner.

Text-Based I/O: Since everything is console-based, I planned simple console.log statements for printBoard and logging the extra-turn messages.

Testing & Iteration: I anticipated writing some manual sequences in an index.js driver to verify extra-turn chaining, captures, invalid inputs, and full-game termination.

Overall, my approach was to scaffold the classes and basic methods first, then incrementally build and test the sow loop, special rules, and end-game conditions. Encapsulating repeated logic into helper methods (_sow, _allPitsEmpty, _oppositeIndex) would keep the code readable and maintainable.



Initial Reflection:
- First thoughts were to understand the game rules thoroughly
- Decided to implement the board as two arrays for each player's pits plus a store
- Planned to handle the circular sowing by tracking current position
- Anticipated challenges with the special rules (extra turns and captures)

Challenges Encountered:
- Implementing the circular sowing logic was tricky
- Handling the special rules required careful state tracking
- Ensuring all edge cases were covered (empty pits, game end conditions)
- Debugging the capture logic took some time

Key Takeaways:
- Breaking down complex game rules into smaller methods helps
- Proper state management is crucial for turn-based games
- Testing each rule separately helps identify issues early
- The implementation became clearer after drawing out the board flow

Final Reflection:
- The implementation meets all the requirements
- The code could be further optimized but prioritizes readability
- Additional helper methods might make the code more modular
- Overall, this was a great exercise in implementing game logic
